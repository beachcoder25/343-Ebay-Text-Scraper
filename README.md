# 343-Ebay-Text-Scraper
This is the project for my 343 Software Engineering Course

We were able to choose our own project, and I am attempting to have a text scraper scrape sites like ebay for desired price points of certain listings, and notify me viab the web/mobile app I will be designing as the project progresses.

This has been my ebst opportunity to explore Python, and come up with a project from scratch. I am learning a lot about aspects of programming I had yet to be exposed to, and am motivated to make the functionality as sleek as possible on this project so I can share the application with friends and acquantinces who could use it.
